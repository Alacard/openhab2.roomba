This repository is dormant and no longer maintained. It was developed aganst an openhab2 beta version and does no longer work

# roohab
openhab2 roomba binding

The current implementation only works with a special addon which acts as a wlan bridge and is not longer available. I experimented with building a bridge of my one with an ESP wlan chip but i never got around finishing this.
